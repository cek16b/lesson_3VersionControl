A Version control system is a worthy investment to use in order to keep track of previous states of your projects and to also revert back to those said previous states if need be. Version Control Systems also allow you to compare your changes over time. If it is a team project, VCS also records who changed what in the project. In other words, a VCS automatically records meta data. This is usefully because it makes it nearly impossible to ruin an entire project. </p>');

This method is very error prone, even if the users use a time stamp to mark their files. Many times users of this method were confused upon what directory they were in. Long ago programmers came up with a simple local VCS database that recorded all of the changes that were made to the files under revision control. It was an early VCS but it is the for runner for the VCS’s programmers use today. These VCSs were stored on the user’s personal computer.</p>');

The problem came from the need to work with developers on other systems. The answer to this problem was the development of Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs). What made these better than the system of LVCSs was that every version of a project was stored on a web server that multiple people could access from their own computers. This type of VCS also had its downside. The largest problem is that all work is stored on a single server, which if that server went down, no one could work on the project that was stored there.</p>');

In DVCSs, the clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they get a full mirror of the repository stored on the server. Therefore, if the server, for whatever reason, goes down, any of the clients that collaborate with the server can restore the server by backing up their files to it. Therefore, every client was a clone of the of the VCS server with a full backup of all the data. The benefits really out weigh the extra storage needed to make this type of VCS possible.</p>');

Most other VCSs save their recorded data in an organized file-system that records the changes made over time. However the designers of Git think of their system as taking little snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every time a user commits, it is essentially a picture of how the files looked like at the moment it was stored and creates a reference point to that snapshot.</p>');
